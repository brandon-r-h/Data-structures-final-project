# Data-structures-final-project

For this project I implemented pandas and hashtables.
I used pandas to load the dataset and sort it nicely to deal with and get the sections I wanted.
I then loaded in my hashtable class and tweaked it to work easily with the three categories of data I wanted to get from the entire dataset. 
The Donation class I made automatically uses pandas and hash tables in the initializer, so as soon as you give the class 
the dataset, the three columns of donor,donee, and amount donated, are sorted in the hashtables.
Then I made other functions in the Donation class to get all the information you want about the donor that is in the dataset.
To do all this you just have to load in  DSfinal.py and create a Donation object with a dataset in the parameters.

This project helped me realize the real world applications of the data structures we learned about in class. 
I think having the data structures and being able to change them for whatever you may need. 

I was able to see all the donations a single individual made throughout 2021 and to who they donated to. 
I expected this to be pretty challenging to do, but I had a lot of fun and the pandas library made it very easy.
